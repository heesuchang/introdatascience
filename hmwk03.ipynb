Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "A young boy and an old woman are playing [tic tac toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). Unfortunately, the boy is too young to know the strategy and the old woman can't see the board well enough to enact a strategy. Nevertheless, they are content to play games with each other. The boy plays first and randomly places an X in an open square. The woman plays next, and randomly places an O in one of the remaining open squares. They each play randomly until someone gets three in a row, and then start a new game. Estimate, via simulation, the probability that the boy wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Part of the goal of this exercises is to give you more practice structuring a simulation. Definitely don't be afraid to write helper functions that get called from your main simulation routine. Things you might want to do modularly are (i) play a single game of tic-tac-toe, (ii) place an $X$ or an $O$ on an free square, or (iii) check if someone has one the game. This problem will not be autograded so feel free to get creative.  Just make sure to clearly display your results in code output and summarize things in Markdown. "

    "As we can see from the result of 10000 simulations of tic tac toe, the probability of the boy winning is higher than that of the old woman since his probability is over 0.5. This makes sense because since the boy goes first, if a match were to go until the entire board fills up, the boy would have 5 'X' on the board and the old woman would only have 4 'O'. It's easier to have 3 in a row if you have more pieces on the board. Even throughout each of the boy's turn before they fill out the board, the boy will always have either one more than the old woman or the same amount of pieces on the board. Therefore, the boy has higher probability of winning than the old woman."

    "You are a data-driven transportation engineer investigating the effect that a particular [vertical lift bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical-lift_bridge) has on city traffic.  Every time a boat passes under the bridge, cars must stop while the bridge is raised to accommodate the height of the boat.  As both boat and car traffic increases, city planners are considering building a new taller bridge that will never impede the flow of traffic. As part of a larger simulation of traffic congestion, you need to decide how to model the arrival of boats at the bridge.  From your Intro to Data Science class you remember that the time _between_ independent arrivals are usually modeled by an Exponential distribution.  Finally, you have access to a report that says on average 20 boats cross under the bridge per day.\n",

    "Answer the following questions about this scenario. **Note** that for **Parts B-D** you should clearly express the computation you're doing with math, but feel free to do any fancy function evaluations with Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A**:  Assuming the between-boat times do in-fact follow $Exp(20)$, what distribution would you expect the **number** of boats that cross under the bridge on a given day to follow?  What are the parameter(s) of the distribution? "

You read a placard explaining that the three eponymous geysers — creatively named $A$, $B$ and $C$ — erupt at intervals of precisely two hours, four hours and six hours, respectively. However, you just got there, so you have no idea how the three eruptions are staggered. Assuming they each started erupting at some independently random point in history, what are the probabilities that A, B and C, respectively, will be the first to erupt after your arrival?\n"
