Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.

    "In soccer tournaments, [penalty shootouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football) are used to determine the outcome of the game if the score is tied after regulation play.   In a penalty shootout, each team takes turns attempting 5 shots on the goal from the penalty mark that are defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper, with the team that makes more successful kicks being declared the winner of the match.  If after 5 shots the score is still tied, the game enters _sudden death_ and the teams continue to take 1 shot each until one team scores and the other does not. \n",

Each team will now take one shot each in an attempt to win.

Let $W$ be the event that \"Team $A$ wins the game\", $E$ be the event that \"the game ends after the first round of sudden death penalty shots\", and $T$ be the event that \"the game is still tied after the first round of sudden death penalty shots\". \n",

    "W and T are independent because being tied after the first round of sudden death penalty shots doesn't affect Team  A's probability p of making the shot or Team B's probability q of making the shot in the next round. Therefore event W isn't affected by the event T. Likewise, the probability that Team A wins doesn't affect the probability of them being tied after the first round of sudden death penalty shots because T is affected by the probability of Team A tying with Team B. A good way to prove this is to see if $P(W) = P(W \\mid T)$ or $P(T) = P(T \\mid W)$. If one of these statements is true, so is the other. And this tells us that W and T are independent. Though $P(W) = P(W \\mid T)$ is hard to explain, we can explain $P(T) = P(T \\mid W)$. The expression states that given that team A won the match, the probability of the game not ending after the first round is the same as the overall probability of the game being tied after the first round. This makes sense because the fact that team A won doesn't increase or decrease the probability that the game was tied after the first round. "

We are looping through each of the neighbor paths just once so we don't need to worry about duplicate of the same paths. Then once we reach that third node in the path, for each of these possible paths, I do two things. First, I check if my final destination is the engineering center. In which case I add 1 to the number of paths that end at the engineering center for Part A. Then, I check if the path I took involved me going to the UMC at all. If so, I add 1 to the number of paths that involve me going to the UMC. Dividing each of these variables by the total number of possible paths give me the desired probabilties.\n",

Once Dan is at the end of each of his possible paths, I check if Chris and Dan are in the same place. This doesn't exactly simulate the situation perfectly because Chris and Dan in my code aren't walking their paths simultaneously. Instead, by simulating Chris walking one possible path and then iterating through each of Dan's possible paths, I can still find out the proper probability since we are only looking at if they meet at the end.

    "Dan and Chris have been playing board games for ages. Among the games they play a lot are Miniopoly and a similar game with slightly tweaked rules called **Fakeiopoly!**  Being Data-Nerds, they like to record the details of each game they play for future analysis.  Since the games are similar, they store the results for Miniopoly and Fakeiopoly in the same database.  Unfortunately, their data has been corrupted!  The only data that survived are the states (i.e. square numbers) they were on after each of the first 20 turns as well a the amount of cash they had on hand after each of the first 20 turns. This information is stored in the columns **S1**-**S20** and **C1**-**C20** in the following DataFrame. "

    "Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "I based a large part of my predictions on checking if our standard rules were being followed. I noticed in a few \"fake\" rows that the state would go from 10 to 23, which is bigger than just the sum of two dice (6-faced). So, I checked all the rows to see if any also went more than 12 at a time. I also checked every time the state was 2 or 7 or 17 or 22 or 33 or 36 and checked if the change in cash matched the cards that we had because I thought it was possible for Fakeopoly to use different cards or pull cards at different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that some \"fake\" games ended in bankrupt very early in the game. While most of the \"real\" games that went bankrupt only went bankrupt after at least 4, turns, some \"fake\" games ended in 3 turns. This may have to do with the fact that Fakeopoly allowed players to move more at a time, resulting in earlier costs of high-state landings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "I observed a lot of histograms. I would compare the same type of data for real and fake. Below are some of the histograms I found somewhat worth mentioning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two histograms in Fig.1 show the distribution of the cash a player held at the end of each 20-turn game. As you can see, the real games had more a higher concentration of players that ended with 0-100 dollars while the fake games expanded out more. The wealthy people tended to be more wealthy in the fake games. So, I found a reasonable cutoff range where mainly \"fake\" games populated and labeled any in that range as fake in my predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a similar reasoning using data as shown in Fig.2. This time, I used the average amount of cash the player held throughout the entire course of the game. I also found fake games had a higher number of wealthier outliers. So, I labeled those in this rnge fake as well. Many in this range that I labeled fake may very well have been in the same set as those I labeled fake in Fig.1 but this still raised my accuracy a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I was going to do certain things with convict (those who were in jail) statistics. I thought the people who had been in jail would offer a more diverse view to how the different rules would affect them. However, as you can see in Fig. 3, there wasn't enough data so I ended up abandoning the use of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I started looking at the histograms, I initially tried a bunch of random rules of prediction and actually got a slightly higher accuracy than I have now. However, none of those were from any significant exploration and analysis, so I disregarded them. In the method I have taken, though my overall accuracy is lower, I believe I have minimized the number of real games being falsely labeled fake. Depending on the circumstances, it may be better to have lower overall accuracy and avoid mislabeling things that are otherwise thought false than giving leiway to mislabeling for better overall accuracy. One such example would be if we were to use machine learning and AI to determine someone guilty or innocent on a charged crime where people are innocent until proven otherwise. We don't want the risk of sending someone to prison for life.\n"

    "One rule that could be different is the number of dice that are rolled to be summed up at each stage. I noticed in one of the \"fake\" labeled rows that the player jumped from 10 to 23. This indicates you can move more than 12 in one stage, which is different from our rules. The rate at which people move across the board seems much larger overall. Using this check gave me a jump in accuracy by 0.61, so I think this is a good prediction."
